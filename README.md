# MataNetra
### MataNetra is a local mapping and navigation application for people with low vision.

### In a campus setting, individuals with 'low vision' often encounter obstacles in navigating to their destinations. Challenges like stairs and unseen constructions impact their independence and overall well-being. Emphasizing inclusivity, our team employs machine learning for object detection and location sensing, aiming to enhance accessibility for those with visual impairments. The project aspires to not only solve practical issues but also establish a foundation of inclusivity and equality, enabling individuals to actively engage in campus life and realize their academic and personal potential.
